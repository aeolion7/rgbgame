# RGB Guessing Game
A simple in-browser RGB color guessing game!

## How It Works:
1) You are given an RGB color value (*Ã  la RGB(255, 0, 255)*) and a randomly-generated set of colored squares.
2) You must guess which of the colored squares represents the generated RGB value.
3) That's it!

Here we go:<img width="1439" alt="screen shot 2018-10-12 at 12 59 50 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38444304/46849046-69a80e80-cdbb-11e8-8ad4-1ed95757227f.png">
Got it!<img width="1440" alt="screen shot 2018-10-12 at 1 00 02 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38444304/46849049-6d3b9580-cdbb-11e8-8b3d-b814f7eaf131.png">

When you guess an incorrect answer, the corresponding color block disappears: <img width="1440" alt="screen shot 2018-10-12 at 1 00 27 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38444304/46849043-62810080-cdbb-11e8-9c0e-f45a88ade417.png">

And that's all there is to it! This is a great way to become more familiar with seeing RGB values as colors instead of numbers!
